<p>
 Welcome! I recently completed my MMath in Mathematics at the University of Oxford. I'm currently applying for PhDs in pure mathematics and mathematical physics.
 Meanwhile, I'm teaching A Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics at <a href="https://www.baconscollege.co.uk/">my old secondary school</a>.
</p>
 <p>
  Here's my  <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a>. Please note that the displayed photo is quite old.
 </p>

 <h2> What I'm doing</h2><hr>

 <p>These days, I balance my time between teaching and scratching my head at nLab entries. </p>

 <h4>Current interests</h4>

 <p> I'm currently learning about: topos theory, ∞-categories, model categories, higher topos theory, derived (differential) geometry, and quantum field theory. 
  I'm writing some of this down in a set of notes called <a href="/mouse.pdf">Doodles of a Mouse</a>, after Johnstone's <i>Sketches of an Elephant</i>. 
 This project is unsupervised, but it has benefitted from various helpful discussions with 
 <a href="https://thosgood.com/">Tim Hosgood</a>, 
 <a href="https://www.emiliominichiello.com/">Emilio Minichiello</a>
 and <a href="https://dmitripavlov.org/">Dmitri Pavlov</a>.
</p>

 <p>
  There are a few projects I want to do...
     <ul>
  <li><p>The <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Isbell+duality">Isbell dual</a> of a C<sup>∞</sup>-ring is a diffeological space, and vice versa. 
   It would be interesting to study properties of diffeological spaces using this connection (such as <a href="https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/blohmann/">Blohmann's</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02583">elasticity</a>, which was suggested to me by Emilio Minichiello). 
   One could also explore this in the higher setting, which seems to appear in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06195">this preprint</a> (though Isbell duality is not explicitly mentioned).</p></li>
  <li><p>It would be interesting to see Morse theory done from the perspective of derived manifolds, dropping transversality assumptions. 
   This could be applied to cobordisms where we don't ignore the singular "topology-changing slices"...</p></li>
   <li><p>
    The "sitting instants" in Schreiber's <a href="https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/files/dcct161227.pdf">DCCT</a> are there to impose fibrancy on the resulting smooth n-groupoids. This is quite an artificial-looking idea, and it would be nice to improve it.
   </p></li>
</ul> 
 </p>

 <h4> Commutative algebra notes</h4>

<p> 
I am writing the official <a href="ca.pdf">lecture notes</a> for the Oxford undergraduate course on commutative algebra, lectured by my college tutor <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/kielak/">Dawid Kielak</a>. 
 These will be based on notes by the previous lecturer <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/rossler/">Damian Rössler</a>, with input from 
 <a href="https://agag-gathmann.math.rptu.de/class/commalg-2013/commalg-2013.pdf" class="file">Gathmann's notes</a> and various student suggestions.
</p>

 <h2>What I've done</h2> <hr>

 <h4> Essays and dissertations</h4>

 <p> My Part C (master's) dissertation was on <a href="url"> Geometric quantisation and Hamiltonian cobordism </a>, 
  supervised by <a href="https://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/about-jesus-college/our-community/people/professor-andrew-dancer/">Andrew Dancer</a>.
 I wrote about quantisation of Kahler manifolds and its interaction with symplectic reduction via Hamiltonian cobordism, 
  following the ideas of Ginzburg--Guillemin--Karshon.

  <p> Before that, I wrote a Part B Essay (bachelor's dissertation) under <a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/cazassus">Guillem Cazassus</a>.
   The title was <a href="url"> Pseudo-holomorphic curves in the complex projective plane </a>, and it is a review of  
Part B Essay (bachelor's thesis) supervised by <a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/cazassus">Guillem Cazassus</a>. <br>
Topics: geometry of 4-manifolds, index theory, Gromov compactness.
</p>

<h4> Summer projects </h4>

 <p> For 10 weeks in the summer of 2023, I did a research project on symplectic topology and mirror symmetry under 
  <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/lotay/">Jason Lotay</a>.
  I was funded by the EPSRC under the vacation grant <i>Computing Fukaya categories inductively with Fukaya-Seidel categories</i>. 
  Fukaya–Seidel categories and Fano HMS <span class="smalllink"> &nbsp;[ <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/lotay/Andres_poster_EPSRC.pdf">poster</a> ]</span> <br> 
Topics: Triangulated A<sub>∞</sub>-categories, symplectic Lefschetz fibrations, coherent sheaves. 
  I produced this <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/lotay/Andres_poster_EPSRC.pdf">poster</a> (hosted at Jason's website) for an EPSRC event.
 
<p> Rotational diffusions on generalised Sierpiński gaskets <br>
Summer 2022, supervised by <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/hambly/">Ben Hambly</a>; funded by Hertford College, Oxford. <br>
Topics: random walks on fractals, numerical methods, harmonic analysis on graphs.
</p>
 
<h4> Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
I was a founding member of the <a href="https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/Texromancers.html">TeXromancers</a>, 
 an online team dedicated to re-typesetting classic mathematical texts (in fact, I came up with the name!). 
 I worked on their first two books: <a href="https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/Adams-SHGH-latex.pdf">Stable Homotopy and Generalised Homology</a> and 
 <a href="https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/assets/hicks.pdf">Notes on Differential Geometry</a>. Sadly, the group has since disbanded.
</p>

<p>
I also wrote an expository article called <a href="https://www.invariants.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/InvariantMT22.pdf">Associative Metrics</a> for the University of Oxford's mathematics society, <a href="https://www.invariants.org.uk/">The Invariants</a>. 
 To be honest, it's not very good; I agreed to write the article under the impression that I had proved a simpler answer to <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/16214">this MathOverflow question</a>, which turned out to be nonsense.
