<p>Welcome! I recently completed my MMath in Mathematics at the University of Oxford. I'm currently taking a year out to teach, before (hopefully!) starting a PhD in 2025.
 I'm interested in higher geometry and diffeology.

<p>Here is a list of the stuff I've written and projects I've been a part of. One day this will all get reorganised properly, but for now it's all here on one page.
</p>
 
 <h4>Projects and dissertations</h4>
Note that both theses have received post-edits to fix typos, and in exceptional cases to provide clarity.

<h4> Lecture notes</h4>

<p> 
I am writing the official notes for the Oxford course on commutative algebra, lectured by my college tutor <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/kielak/">Dawid Kielak</a>. 
 These will be based on notes by the previous lecturer <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/rossler/">Damian Rössler</a>, with input from 
 <a href="https://agag-gathmann.math.rptu.de/class/commalg-2013/commalg-2013.pdf" class="file">Gathmann's notes</a> and various student suggestions.
</p>
 
<h4> Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
I was a founding member of the <a href="https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/Texromancers.html">TeXromancers</a>, 
 an online team dedicated to re-typesetting classic mathematical texts (in fact, I came up with the name!). 
 I worked on their first two books: <a href="https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/Adams-SHGH-latex.pdf">Stable Homotopy and Generalised Homology</a> and 
 <a href="https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/assets/hicks.pdf">Notes on Differential Geometry</a>. Sadly, the group has since disbanded.
</p>

<p>
I also wrote an expository article called <a href="https://www.invariants.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/InvariantMT22.pdf">Associative Metrics</a> for the University of Oxford's mathematics society, <a href="https://www.invariants.org.uk/">The Invariants</a>. To be honest, it's not very good; I agreed to write the article under the impression that I had proved a simpler answer to <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/16214">this MathOverflow question</a>, which turned out to be nonsense.
