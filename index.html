<h1>Andres Klene</h1>
<p>Welcome! I recently completed my undergraduate Master's degree at the University of Oxford.

<h2> Mathematical interests </h2>
<p>A couple of years ago, I was taken by symplectic geometry. So much so that, in my third year of undergrad, I wrote an essay on the technique of pseudo-holomorphic curves. I was very lucky to be supervised by Dr. Guillem Cazassus, who invited me to learn some Floer theory at the <a href="https://lrobert.perso.math.cnrs.fr/BTW3/btw3.html" class="person">BTW3 workshop</a>.
</p><p> With the basic analytic foundations under my belt, I did a summer project on some algebraic and topological aspects of the subject; more specifically, (derived) Fukaya categories associated to Lefschetz fibrations. 
These objects have strong links to the homological mirror symmetry of Fano varieties, which became my focus. 
</p><p>
This project opened my eyes to the interplay between geometry and theoretical physics. I wrote my master's dissertation on geometric quantisation in keeping with this theme. Meanwhile, I moved away from analysis and towards categorical methods; the following summer I studied higher parallel transport.
</p>
<h1>Stuff I've written</h1>
<p>Here is a list of the written work I completed at—and after—university. Some have received  post-edits to fix typos and (in the case of summer projects) provide clarity. There is no claim to originality of content.
</p>

<h2> Lecture notes</h2>
<p> 
<b> Commutative Algebra </b> <br>
I wrote the official notes for the Oxford course on commutative algebra lectured by <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/kielak/" class="person">Prof. Dawid Kielak</a>. These are based on notes by the previous lecturer <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/rossler/" class="person">Prof. Damian Rössler</a>, with input from <a href="https://agag-gathmann.math.rptu.de/class/commalg-2013/commalg-2013.pdf" class="file">Gathmann's notes</a> and various student suggestions. <br>

</p>
<h2> Other?</h2>
<p>
<b> Stable Homotopy and Generalised Homology </b> <br>
I volunteered as part of the <a href="https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/Texromancers.html" class="person">TeXromancers</a> (now disbanded). I contributed to the electronic re-typesetting of a classic algebraic topology textbook by J. F. Adams. More importantly, I came up with the name "TeXromancers"!<br>

</p>

<p>
<b> Associative Metrics </b> <br>
I wrote an expository article for the University of Oxford's mathematics society, <a href="https://www.invariants.org.uk/" class="person">The Invariants</a>. To be honest, it's not very good; I agreed to write the article under the impression that I had proved something (a simpler answer to <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/16214" class="person">this question</a>) which, once I wrote it up properly, was nonsense.<br>
