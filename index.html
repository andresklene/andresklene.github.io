<p>Welcome! I recently completed my MMath in Mathematics at the University of Oxford. </p>
<p>
A couple of years ago, I wrote my third-year essay on pseudo-holomorphic curves. I was very lucky to be supervised by <a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/cazassus">Dr. Guillem Cazassus</a>, who invited me to learn some Floer theory at the <a href="https://lrobert.perso.math.cnrs.fr/BTW3/btw3.html" class="person">BTW3 workshop</a> in Marseille. 
 That summer, I did a summer project on symplectic topology under <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/lotay/">Prof. Jason Lotay</a>, where I studied Fukaya categories associated to Lefschetz fibrations and their role in the homological mirror symmetry of Fano varieties. 
 I wrote my master's dissertation on geometric quantisation.</p><p>I am currently learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerbe">gerbes</a> and <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/higher+parallel+transport">higher parallel transport</a>!</p>
</p>
<h2 id="projects">Writing</h2>

<p>Here is a list of the written work I completed at (and directly after) university. Some have received post-edits to fix typos and provide clarity. There is no claim to any originality of content.
</p>

<h4>Undergraduate theses</h4>

<p> <a href="url"> Geometric quantisation and Hamiltonian cobordism </a> <br>
Part C Dissertation (master's thesis) supervised by <a href="https://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/about-jesus-college/our-community/people/professor-andrew-dancer/">Prof. Andrew Dancer</a>.<br> 
 Topics: Hamiltonian group actions, virtual Hilbert representations, Hamiltonian cobordism.

<p> <a href="url"> Pseudo-holomorphic curves in the complex projective plane </a> <br> 
Part B Essay (bachelor's thesis) supervised by Dr. Guillem Cazassus. <br>
Topics: geometry of 4-manifolds, index theory, Gromov compactness.
</p>
 
 <h4>Summer projects</h4>
 
<p> Gerbes and stuff (in progress) <br> 
Summer 2024; unsupervised.</p>

<p> <a href="url"> Fukaya–Seidel categories and Fano HMS</a> <span class="smalllink"> &nbsp;[ <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/lotay/Andres_poster_EPSRC.pdf">poster</a>]</span> <br> 
Summer 2023, supervised by Prof. Jason Lotay; funded by the EPSRC. <br> 
Topics: Triangulated A<sub>∞</sub>-categories, symplectic Lefschetz fibrations, coherent sheaves.

<p> <a href="url">Rotational diffusions on generalised Sierpiński gaskets</a> <br>
Summer 2022, supervised by <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/hambly/">Prof. Ben Hambly</a>; funded by Hertford College, Oxford. <br>
Topics: random walks on fractals, numerical methods, harmonic analysis on graphs.
</p>

<h4> Lecture notes</h4>

<p> 
I am writing the official notes for the Oxford course on commutative algebra lectured by my college tutor <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/kielak/">Prof. Dawid Kielak</a>. These will be based on notes by the previous lecturer <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/rossler/">Prof. Damian Rössler</a>, with input from <a href="https://agag-gathmann.math.rptu.de/class/commalg-2013/commalg-2013.pdf" class="file">Gathmann's notes</a> and various student suggestions.
</p>
 
<h4> Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
I was a founding member of the <a href="https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/Texromancers.html">TeXromancers</a>, an online team dedicated to re-typesetting classic mathematical texts (in fact, I came up with the name!). I worked on their first two books: <a href="https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/Adams-SHGH-latex.pdf">Stable Homotopy and Generalised Homology</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Adams">J. F. Adams</a> and <a href="https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/assets/hicks.pdf">Notes on Differential Geometry</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Hicks">Noel Nicks</a>. Sadly, they are now disbanded.
</p>

<p>
I also wrote an expository article called <a href="https://www.invariants.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/InvariantMT22.pdf">Associative Metrics</a> for the University of Oxford's mathematics society, <a href="https://www.invariants.org.uk/">The Invariants</a>. To be honest, it's not very good; I agreed to write the article under the impression that I had proved a simpler answer to <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/16214">this MathOverflow question</a>, which turned out to be nonsense.
