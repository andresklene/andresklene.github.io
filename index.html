<p>
 In 2024 I completed my MMath in Mathematics at the University of Oxford. Here's a <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a>. Email address: andres.klene⊗outlook.com
</p>
 <p>
 I'm currently applying for PhDs in mathematics.
 Meanwhile, I'm teaching A-Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics at <a href="https://www.baconscollege.co.uk/">Bacon's College, London</a>.
 </p>

 <h3>interests</h3>
 <p> My undergraduate background is in symplectic geometry. I'm currently learning some (∞-)category theory, higher/derived geometry, and various applications in theoretical physics.
  I'm writing some of this down in a set of notes called "Doodles of a Mouse" (after Johnstone's 
  <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Sketches+of+an+Elephant">Sketches of an Elephant</a>). 
</p>
 
 <h3> dissertations</h3>

 <p> My Part C (master's) dissertation was on <a href="gq.pdf"> Geometric quantisation and Hamiltonian cobordism</a>, 
  supervised by <a href="https://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/about-jesus-college/our-community/people/professor-andrew-dancer/">Andrew Dancer</a>.
Before that, I wrote a Part B (bachelor's) essay on <a href="p2.pdf"> Pseudo-holomorphic curves in the complex projective plane </a>, under <a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/cazassus">Guillem Cazassus</a>.
</p>

<h3> summer projects </h3>

 <p> In 2023, I did a summer project on symplectic topology and mirror symmetry, funded by the EPSRC and supervised by <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/lotay/">Jason Lotay</a>. 
  I studied triangulated A<sub>∞</sub>-categories, symplectic Lefschetz fibrations, and toric varieties. At the end, I tried to verify homological mirror symmetry for the one-point blowup of ℙ<sup>3</sup>, 
  producing a <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/lotay/Andres_poster_EPSRC.pdf">poster</a> for an EPSRC event.
 </p>
 
<p> In 2022, I did a summer project on fractal geometry and stochastic analysis, funded by Hertford College and supervised by <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/hambly/">Ben Hambly</a>. 
 I wrote a short <a href="report.pdf">report</a> to prove to Hertford College that I hadn't been stealing their money.
</p>
 
<h3> miscellaneous</h3>
<p>
I was a founding member of the <a href="https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/Texromancers.html">TeXromancers</a>, 
 an online team dedicated to re-typesetting classic mathematical texts (in fact, I came up with the name!). 
 I worked on their first two books: <a href="https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/Adams-SHGH-latex.pdf">Stable Homotopy and Generalised Homology</a> and 
 <a href="https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/assets/hicks.pdf">Notes on Differential Geometry</a>. Sadly, the group has since disbanded.
</p>

<p>
I also wrote an expository article called <a href="https://www.invariants.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/InvariantMT22.pdf">Associative Metrics</a> for the University of Oxford's mathematics society, <a href="https://www.invariants.org.uk/">The Invariants</a>. 
 To be honest, it's not very good; I agreed to write the article under the impression that I had found a simpler answer to <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/16214">this MathOverflow question</a>, which turned out to be nonsense.
