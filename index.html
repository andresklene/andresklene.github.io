<p>Welcome! I recently completed my MMath in Mathematics at the University of Oxford. I'm teaching A Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics at Bacon's College in London.
</p>
 <p>
 Broadly, I'm interested in differential geometry, (higher) category theory, mathematical physics, and their intersections. Right now I'm thinking about:
 </p> <p>
   <ul>
  <li>Smooth category theory: diffeological spaces, C^infinity rings, and their interactions via Isbell duality. </li>
  <li>Derived differential geometry: higher stacks and applications to elliptic moduli problems</li>
  <li>insert stuff...</li>
</ul> 
</p> <p>
 I'm currently applying for PhDs in pure mathematics and mathematical physics. Here's my  <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a>.
</p>

 <h2>Work</h2> <hr>
 <p>Here's some work I've done. This includes undergrad theses, summer projects, lecture notes, and more.</p>

 <h4> Essays and dissertations</h4>
 
<p> I am currently working on a set of notes called <a href="/mouse.pdf">Doodles of a Mouse</a>, after Johnstone's <i>Sketches of an Elephant</i>. 
 When completed, it will be an introduction to the foundations of higher geometry, including aspects of: 
 topos theory, infinity-categories, model categories, higher topos theory, derived geometry, and applications to mathematical physics. 
 This project is unsupervised, but it has benefitted from various helpful discussions with 
 <a href="https://thosgood.com/">Tim Hosgood</a>, 
 <a href="https://www.emiliominichiello.com/">Emilio Minichiello</a>
 and <a href="https://dmitripavlov.org/">Dmitri Pavlov</a>. 
</p>

 <p> My Part C (master's) dissertation was on <a href="url"> Geometric quantisation and Hamiltonian cobordism </a>, 
  supervised by <a href="https://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/about-jesus-college/our-community/people/professor-andrew-dancer/">Andrew Dancer</a>.
 I wrote about quantisation of Kahler manifolds and its interaction with symplectic reduction via Hamiltonian cobordism, 
  following the ideas of Ginzburg--Guillemin--Karshon.

  <p> Before that, I wrote a Part B Essay (bachelor's dissertation) under <a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/cazassus">Guillem Cazassus</a>.
   The title was <a href="url"> Pseudo-holomorphic curves in the complex projective plane </a>, and it is a review of  
Part B Essay (bachelor's thesis) supervised by <a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/cazassus">Guillem Cazassus</a>. <br>
Topics: geometry of 4-manifolds, index theory, Gromov compactness.
</p>

<h4> Summer projects </h4>

 <p> For 10 weeks in the summer of 2023, I did a research project on symplectic topology and mirror symmetry under 
  <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/lotay/">Jason Lotay</a>.
  I was funded by the EPSRC under the vacation grant <i>Computing Fukaya categories inductively with Fukaya-Seidel categories</i>. 
  Fukaya–Seidel categories and Fano HMS <span class="smalllink"> &nbsp;[ <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/lotay/Andres_poster_EPSRC.pdf">poster</a> ]</span> <br> 
Topics: Triangulated A<sub>∞</sub>-categories, symplectic Lefschetz fibrations, coherent sheaves. 
  I produced this <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/lotay/Andres_poster_EPSRC.pdf">poster</a> (hosted at Jason's website) for an EPSRC event.
 
<p> Rotational diffusions on generalised Sierpiński gaskets <br>
Summer 2022, supervised by <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/hambly/">Ben Hambly</a>; funded by Hertford College, Oxford. <br>
Topics: random walks on fractals, numerical methods, harmonic analysis on graphs.
</p>

<h4> Lecture notes</h4>

<p> 
I am writing the official notes for the Oxford course on commutative algebra, lectured by my college tutor <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/kielak/">Dawid Kielak</a>. 
 These will be based on notes by the previous lecturer <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/rossler/">Damian Rössler</a>, with input from 
 <a href="https://agag-gathmann.math.rptu.de/class/commalg-2013/commalg-2013.pdf" class="file">Gathmann's notes</a> and various student suggestions.
</p>
 
<h4> Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>
I was a founding member of the <a href="https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/Texromancers.html">TeXromancers</a>, 
 an online team dedicated to re-typesetting classic mathematical texts (in fact, I came up with the name!). 
 I worked on their first two books: <a href="https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/Adams-SHGH-latex.pdf">Stable Homotopy and Generalised Homology</a> and 
 <a href="https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/assets/hicks.pdf">Notes on Differential Geometry</a>. Sadly, the group has since disbanded.
</p>

<p>
I also wrote an expository article called <a href="https://www.invariants.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/InvariantMT22.pdf">Associative Metrics</a> for the University of Oxford's mathematics society, <a href="https://www.invariants.org.uk/">The Invariants</a>. To be honest, it's not very good; I agreed to write the article under the impression that I had proved a simpler answer to <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/16214">this MathOverflow question</a>, which turned out to be nonsense.
